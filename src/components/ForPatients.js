    <p>Welcome to Medical Pricing Transparency (MPT). We all know how difficult it is to find out pricing information and shop around before we go to the doctor. MPT is here to help you find the true cost of healthcare and specific medical treatments so you can make an informed decision. And please share it with your friends and family. The more people use this app, the better it gets. Please also consider coming back and anonymously submitting the cost you paid for particular treatments so our price estimation calculation will become more accurate. Thanks for using MPT.</p>

    <h5>Figure out where and when you need to enroll</h5>
    <p>Depending where you live, you can either use the federal exchanges on <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov">on here </a> or your state's marketplace to shop for insurance. Washington State runs it's own exchanges <a href="https://www.hca.wa.gov/"> here</a>.The federal exchange open enrollment runs until mid-December, but you might have more time if you live in a state that runs its own marketplace.</p>

    <h5>Know your rights</h5>
    <p>Back in 1998, the US Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry adopted what is familiarly known as “The Patient’s Bill of Rights.” This bill was updated in 2010 alongside the Affordable Care Act (ACA), but the original basic tenets have remained the same.</p>

    <h5>Compare estimated yearly costs, not just monthly premiums</h5>
    <p>It's easy to focus on the monthly premium payment when comparing plans, but don't forget to consider other costs as well.</p>
    <p>The premium price is prominently featured when you're looking at plans, but look at other costs too. A tool available on <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov">here</a> and some state marketplaces will calculate "estimated total yearly costs" for you. This takes into account the plan's deductible — how much you have to pay out-of-pocket for covered services before your insurance picks up the tab — and copays, put together with how much health care you expect to use in the coming year. </p>

    <h5>Consider how much health care you use</h5>
    <p>Picking the right insurance plan involves guesswork about how many health issues you're likely to face in the coming year, which could affect the way costs break down. Your age is usually a useful proxy for this, but there's always a lot of unknowns, like a surprise cancer diagnosis or a car accident.</p>

    <h5>Get free help from the pros</h5>
    <p>Insurance Brokers are experts who can help you shop for plans, understand financial help, and get you enrolled. Navigators can help you get enrolled and answer any general questions you have about your health insurance options or the application process. Help from brokers and navigators are typically free for people of any income level.</p>
