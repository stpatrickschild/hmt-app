    <h2>Elected Officials, Policy Makers, and Civil Servants</h2>

    <p>Welcome to MPT and thank you for visiting our site. MPT is a non for profit organization that aims to foster a healthier and more productive society. For that to happen, healthcare should be a “right” and not a privilege reserved only for the wealthy and for the lucratively employed. Needless to say that we support universal health care.
      MLK once said “only light can drive out darkness”. There is darkness in today’s healthcare market. Patients are intentionally being denied access to health care cost information. The healthcare industry is the only industry that forces you to buy a product without telling you the cost upfront. This happens in no other industry. You, as an elected official or policy maker, have a role to play in bringing some “light” into our healthcare system. The tax payers, the citizens of this state, and the consumers that drive the economy of this state collectively spend a lot of money on health insurance and on health care. However, without the price transparency, we the citizens don’t have enough information to make an informed decision on whether and where to get healthcare. So we end up going to any doctor without any guarantee that we will get a fairly priced care. No one picks up a cellphone or a car from the store and start using it without first asking what the cost is. That should be the case in health care. </p>

    <p>Moreover, you the elected officials have a responsibility to ensure that some healthcare providers are not taking advantage of the “darkness” and price gouging or price fixing to benefit themselves at the cost of the citizens of this state. A free market can’t properly operate in darkness. We can’t tell if providers are playing by the rules if we don’t know how much they are charging for their services. </p>

    <p>Here at MPT ask you to use your power to require healthcare providers and insurance companies to be transparent in what they charge patients. This will reduce the stress for patients and families and help them plan for their care. It will also reduce the spread of diseases in our community by enabling consumers to go seek care when they need it by removing the reluctance due to the lack of transparency. Transparency also fosters competition which in turn typically help curb the rising cost of healthcare or even reduce the cost. That will save consumers and the state a great deal of money that can be invested elsewhere to make our communities better.</p>
