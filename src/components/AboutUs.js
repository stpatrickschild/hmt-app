    <h2>From Hannah </h2>
    <p>Hi, I’m Hannah, the creator of this Medical Pricing Transparency website. Have you ever had to go to the doctor or an emergency room and after you get whatever treatment, you start anxiously waiting for the bills to start arriving? Or anxiously praying for the bills to stop arriving? Well, I have. A long time ago, I had a medical procedure that, at the time was fully covered by my health insurance. But two years after my treatment the bills haven’t stopped arriving. Not only were they coming to me, but they also had been sent to a collection agency without me even know that I have an unpaid balance. After that experience, I always try to research and learn about how much any medical treatment costs before I even go to the doctor – mostly I end up frustrated and no more informed than when I start searching. And when I asked my doctors, often, I get none satisfying answer or a “please contact our billing department”.  </p>

    <p>Recently, while listening to NPR, I discovered that they have a monthly special program called “Bill of the Month”. In this program, NPR in collaboration with Kaiser Health, ask listeners to send them their experience with health care costs and billing practices and they feature what they think is the most outrageous incidents. And that program, my own aforementioned experience, and experiences of friends and family members, compelled me to do my part to find a solution to the lack of pricing transparency in our healthcare system. </p>

    <p>The lack of information about how much health care, and more particularly, how much different health procedures and treatments cost puts families under a lot of stress. Some people endlessly postpone getting a check-up or a treatment for fear of what the financial costs would be – this causes people’s health to further deteriorate until it becomes an emergency. But if we have reliable information about the cost of health care, we would make informed decisions. </p>

    <p>Medical Pricing Transparency (MPT) is my attempt in solving that healthcare cost information desert. You can come to MPT, select the type of healthcare treatment that you or your loved ones need, and see the estimated price breakdowns for the treatment. You can also see the cost comparison between different healthcare providers so you can choose your health provider wisely. </p>
   

    <h2>Vision and goal </h2>

    <p>To give patients accurate medical procedure cost. For Washington State policy maker to create regulations and have both physician and insurance companies be transparent by having cost availabile for us, and have them Comply with the Washington State regulations.My hope and vision is for state of Washington to lead by example. The only way to measure change is to comepare data that is availabile to measure.
