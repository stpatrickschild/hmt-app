    <h5>Doctors and Health Care Providers</h5>
    <p>Dear healthcare providers (doctors, nurses, therapists, CNAs, …), thank you for visiting MPT.</p>
    <p>We know that your number one priority is be helping your patients. Your number two priority is helping all patients – at least, we at MPT like to think so. In your experience as a healthcare provider, you must have seen time and again how patients come to the hospital after their symptoms have gotten unbearable – and not at the start of a symptom. And you know many people don’t go to a doctor for the recommended regular check-up – many don’t even have a family physician. One of the main reasons for this is that patients don’t know an easy way to determine how much a check-up or treatment will cost them out of pocket, even when they have an insurance because most insurance plans don’t cover the full cost of healthcare. Sometimes, people wait until it is too late to see a doctor. Sometime, people with communicable disease will spread the virus/bacteria into their community, not because they are reckless, but because they don’t go get a check-up for fear of the unknown costs of getting a check-up, and so they don’t know they are carrying a communicable disease. This makes our community less healthy by keeping viruses and bacteria to continue to circulate in the community. </p>

    <p>In short, it should be obvious to all that the lack of health care cost transparency makes our communities less safe by preventing people to seek timely care. Even after patients go for treatment, they won’t find out the true cost until the bills start arriving. And this puts people in a lot of financial stress. And we all know that stress of any sort affects people’s immunity negatively. </p>

    <p>So how can I help, you ask? Well, I’m glad you asked. You can start by keeping track of how much your patients get billed for all sorts of treatment and start giving your patients an honest estimate when they ask you. Sometimes even when they don’t ask you. You are in a position to see the cost disparities between different healthcare providers. That can enable you to advice your patients and potential patients where they can find a more cost effective treatment. </p>
    <p>But if you want to help all patients, not just your own patients, you can share the cost of specific treatments with us. You can provide these data to MPT anonymously (we will soon have instructions on how to do that in this website). But remember to remove any personally identifiable information about your patients and yourself. Jus the cost for procedures and the health care provider. And maybe the breakdown of the amount covered by insurance (which insurance) and the amount that the patient has to pay out of pocket. Apps like Glass Door or Blind help employees anonymously share salary or total compensation information with each other so they can negotiate a better pay when they get promoted or get a new job offer. Similarly, if healthcare providers, who are in a position to anonymously share healthcare price data with the public, they can help ensure the public has enough information to make an informed decision when shopping for health care. </p>
    <h5>Insurance Companies</h5>
    <p>Please put people before profit. People are dying because of the greed that pervades the health insurance market. Please stop selling health insurance policies that provide no help until patients have spent thousands of dollars out of pocket first. </p>
    <p>We at MPT are committed to shed light in the hidden and unfair practices of the healthcare and health insurance industry. We will be exposing the malpractices in the industry. If you are one of the few Insurance or Care providers, please help us put the consumer on the driver’s seat by sharing as much data as possible about the costs of treatment and drugs. Reach out to us in how to help our goal to bring transparency to the market. Thank you.</p>
